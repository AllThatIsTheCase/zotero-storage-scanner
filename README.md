# Zotero Storage Scanner

This plugin scans your storage for missing attachments and possible duplicates

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://raw.github.com/retorquere/zotero-storage-scanner/master/zotero-storage-scanner-0.0.16.xpi).

## Support -- read carefully

My time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I cannot accept bug reports
or support requests on anything but the latest version, currently at **0.0.16**. If you submit an issue report,
please include the version that you are on. By the time I get to your issue, the latest version might have bumped up already, and you
will have to upgrade (you might have auto-upgraded already however) and re-verify that your issue still exists. Apologies for the inconvenience, but such
are the breaks.
